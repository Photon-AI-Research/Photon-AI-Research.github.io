Laser-plasma accelerators make large, conventional particle accelerators more compact, less costly, as well as increase broad availability and access in science, industry and medicine. However, comprehension of the involved physics requires sophisticated and computationally demanding algorithms for simulation and reconstruction. The Helmholtz AI young investigator group aims to close the loop between theory and experiment by researching data-driven digital twinning techniques that stimulate theoretical comprehension as well as experimental validation of the very complex dynamics involved in laser-particle acceleration.

Research focus
======
Our declared goal is to research **digital twins of future Laser-driven particle accelerators** which comprises of surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification / outlier detection as well as solution of inverse imaging problems for fast understanding of experimental data.

We therefore research recent surrogate modelling techniques such as Physics-informed Neural Networks for acceleration of state-of-the-art Particle-In-Cell simulations ([PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu)) and identification of unmodelled dynamics from data (PDE identification & learning).  Those dynamics are experimentally observed, e.g. X-ray diffraction experiments, by reconstruction of diffraction data by reliable neural networks. The latter revolutionize the way scattering experiments are carried out by fast and reliable data analysis leveraging large amounts of training data and injection of prior knowledge into the inference procedure of neural networks.

Team
======
[**Dr. Ritz-Ann Aguilar**]() is researching generative models for inversion of
Proton-Beam diagnostics at [HZDR](http://hzdr.de/fwk) as well as X-ray
diffraction patterns (e.g. Holography, SAXS) acquired at
[EuropeanXFEL](https://www.xfel.eu) together with experimentalists,
computational physicists and data scientists within the [Smart
Phase](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/project/smartphase/) and [VIPR]() projects.

[**Jeyhun Rustamov**]() is leading our development of INN architectures within
the [VIPR]() project.

[**Tobias Haenel**]() is working in Bayesian optimization optimzation of Laser
parameters for laser-plasma acceleration experiments.

[**Dr. Ankush Checkervarty**]() is heading our efforts to develop
virtual beam diagnostics, within the [ROCK-IT](https://www.rock-it-project.de/)
project, to improve understanding and control of non-linear
components in particle beam lines.
